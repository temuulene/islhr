# Colours for Island Health's health geographies.
#
# Staff often compare the 14 local health areas (LHAs) in one figure. No
# palette makes 14 categories identifiable by colour alone, and the brand
# standard forbids relying on colour alone when it carries meaning. So colour
# is organised in two levels:
#
# * The health service delivery area (HSDA) picks the colour family. South,
#   Central and North Vancouver Island take Blue, Cedar and Thistle: low-signal
#   families, which the brand standard reserves for organising content, with
#   Blue, the primary family, among them. Red, Green and Orange keep their
#   signal meanings, and Grey keeps "inactive or unavailable".
# * The LHA picks the value within the family.
#
# Values were chosen against LHA adjacency computed from the BC Data Catalogue
# boundaries. Neighbours within an HSDA differ by at least 20 values, and
# neighbours across HSDAs by at least 10 as well as in hue. South and North
# never touch, which keeps Blue and Thistle, the pair protanopia confuses most,
# apart on every map. Every value is 70 or darker, so each fill clears the
# brand's 30-value contrast for graphics on white. None falls between 50 and
# 60, so each fill carries large text in white (50 or below) or Grey 10 (60 or
# above).
#
# Codes and names are the BC Data Catalogue's Local Health Area boundaries.

#' Island Health health service delivery areas and local health areas
#'
#' Returns the brand colour for each of Island Health's 3 health service
#' delivery areas (HSDAs) or 14 local health areas (LHAs), with the codes and
#' names used by the BC Data Catalogue.
#'
#' Each HSDA has its own colour family: Blue for South, Cedar for Central and
#' Thistle for North Vancouver Island. Each LHA takes a different value within
#' its HSDA's family, so a figure reads by HSDA at a glance and neighbouring
#' LHAs stay distinct on a map. The colours are fixed, so an LHA looks the same
#' in every report.
#'
#' The brand standard allows more than two colour families only when colour
#' carries meaning, and then never as the only cue. Label each area, on the
#' map or at the end of each line. For line charts, facetting by `hsda` leaves
#' 4 to 6 lines of one family in each panel.
#'
#' @param level `"lha"` for local health areas or `"hsda"` for health service
#'   delivery areas.
#'
#' @return A data frame in code order with columns `code`, `name`, `colour`
#'   and `label_colour`, plus `hsda` for LHAs. `label_colour` is white or
#'   Grey 10, whichever meets the brand's contrast for large text (18 px, or
#'   about 14 pt, and preferably bold) on `colour`. Smaller labels belong
#'   outside the shape.
#'
#' @seealso [scale_fill_islh_area()] to use the colours in a plot.

#' Island Health colours for local health areas and HSDAs
