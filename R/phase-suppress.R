# Disclosure control.

# These implement mechanics, not policy. The threshold, the rounding base and
# whether complementary suppression is needed all depend on the release and on
# your privacy office. Nothing here has a default that decides that for you.

#' Suppress small cell counts across a data frame
#'
#' Applies [islh_suppress()] to several columns at once.
#'
#' @section Complementary suppression:
#'
#' Set `complementary = TRUE` when the table also shows a total, or when the
#' rows partition a known population. Suppressing a single cell in such a table
#' does not protect it: a reader subtracts the visible cells from the total and
#' recovers the value. Complementary suppression hides the next-smallest cell
#' as well so the arithmetic no longer closes.
#'
#' A complementary cell is hidden because of where it sits in the table, not
#' because it is small — it can be any size at all. It therefore never takes
#' `label`, which describes a small value. It takes `complementary_label`,
#' which defaults to a neutral `"Suppressed"`. Labelling a complementary cell
#' `"<5"` would publish a false statement about the data.
#'
#' Whether you need complementary suppression, and how many cells to hide, is a
#' disclosure policy question rather than a statistical one. Check the rule your
#' release is governed by before publishing.
#'
#' @param data A data frame.
#' @param cols Columns to suppress. Character names or numeric positions.
#' @param threshold Approved disclosure-control threshold. It must be supplied
#'   explicitly because the appropriate rule depends on the data and context.
#' @param inclusive Suppress positive counts less than or equal to the
#'   threshold.
#' @param label Display label for cells hidden because they are small. With
#'   `NULL`, they become missing numeric values. See the label section of
#'   [islh_suppress()].
#' @param complementary Also suppress the smallest surviving value in any
#'   column where exactly one cell was suppressed.
#' @param complementary_label Display label for cells hidden to protect another
#'   cell. Must not imply a value, since such a cell can be any size. Only used
#'   when `label` is set; with no `label` every suppressed cell becomes a
#'   missing value and the column stays numeric.
#'
#' @return The data frame, with the named columns suppressed.

#' Round counts to a fixed base
#'
#' Rounding to a base is used alongside, or instead of, suppression when a
#' release must show every cell. `"nearest"` rounds deterministically, so the
#' same input always gives the same output. `"random"` (sometimes called
#' controlled or unbiased rounding) rounds up or down with probability set by
#' how far the value sits between the two neighbouring multiples, which removes
#' the systematic bias that deterministic rounding introduces in a total.
#'
#' Random rounding gives a different answer each run unless you set a seed, so
#' round once and save the result rather than rounding at render time.
#'
#' @param x Counts to round. Must be whole, non-negative and finite.
#' @param base Rounding base. Like the suppression threshold, this is a
#'   disclosure policy decision, so it must be supplied explicitly.
#' @param method `"nearest"` for deterministic rounding, `"random"` for
#'   controlled random rounding.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector of rounded counts.
