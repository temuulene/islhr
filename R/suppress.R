#' Suppress small cell counts
#'
#' Replaces counts at or below an approved threshold, so a small cell is not
#' published. Zero is never suppressed: nobody having the thing is a real,
#' publishable finding, and hiding it removes information without protecting
#' anyone.
#'
#' @section Choosing a label:
#'
#' A label is a statement about the data, and it has to be true of every cell
#' it is applied to. `"<5"` is false for a cell equal to 5, which the default
#' `inclusive = TRUE` rule suppresses. Either use `inclusive = FALSE` with
#' `"<5"`, or use a neutral label such as `"Suppressed"`. Compact numeric
#' bounds such as `"<5"` and `"<=5"` are checked against the rule and rejected
#' when they could misstate a suppressed value.
#'
#' @param n Count vector. Must be whole, non-negative and finite. Factors are
#'   rejected rather than converted, because converting one gives its level
#'   codes rather than the counts it displays.
#' @param threshold Approved disclosure-control threshold. It must be supplied
#'   explicitly because the appropriate rule depends on the data and context.
#' @param inclusive Suppress positive counts less than or equal to the
#'   threshold. Must be one non-missing `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
#' @param label Display label for suppressed cells. Must be `NULL` or one
#'   non-missing character string. With `NULL`, suppressed values become
#'   missing numeric values; otherwise the result is a character vector.
#'
#' @return A vector with small positive cell counts suppressed.
