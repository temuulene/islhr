# Keeping a scaffolded project up to date.
#
# `islh_create_report()` copies the Quarto extension, `_brand.yml` and the
# logos into a project, because Quarto reads them from the project directory
# rather than from an R library. That copy then ages: a fix to the Word
# reference document reaches nobody who scaffolded before it.
#
# Re-copying blindly is not the answer either. People edit `_brand.yml` for a
# programme's own colours and add things to the extension, and overwriting that
# without warning loses work with no way back.
#
# So the project records what was installed. Comparing three hashes — what the
# package ships, what was installed, and what is on disk now — separates a file
# that is merely out of date from one somebody has edited, and only the first
# is safe to replace.
